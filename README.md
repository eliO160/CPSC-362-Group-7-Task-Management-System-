# CPSC-362 Group 7 Task Management System
**Team members:** Emil Shahbazov, Aaron Tang, Brian Tang, Jair De Orta, Elizabeth Ovieda


## Project Summary:
This simple task manager enables a user to create a task with a description and due date, and then track the task's progress between three columns: To Do, Work in Progress, and Completed. 

The user can update any task field after it is created and drop or delete a task. The fourth column, Dropped, allows the user to move a task off the To Do or Work in Progress columns, but still see the task information if needed. 

The frontend code is powered by HTML and backend is _tk_.
